# webkit-normalize.css

A CSS resets, optimized for mobile browser(webkit engine) and local zh_CN specially.


**NPM**

```sh
yarn add webkit-normalize.css
```

A fork of project [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)

A simple css resets, and I try to balance the style work between "normalize by me" and "cascading by you".
